            My name is Jermo Barbereaux Swaab, I was born and raised in Breda,
            but I currently reside in Amstelveen. At this very moment I'm
            following a Software Developer course over at the ROcVA Amstelland.
            Developing apps and learning more and more about the technologies
            behind software development gets me excited!
            <br /><br />
            Of course I don't dedicate 100% of my life to coding, I also like to
            create content on YouTube, play video games, build PCs and I love
            live streaming(Podcasts).

            This study focusses on web development, here I'm learning how to

            documentation, testing and maintenance.
            <br /><br />
            During the 3 years of this study, roughly 60% of the time is spent
            in class. The remaining 40% is spent obtaining job-experience at
            internships.
