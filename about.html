            My name is Jermo Barbereaux Swaab, I was born and raised in Breda,
            but I currently reside in Amstelveen. As of June 2020 I have completed my 
            Intermediate Vocational Education level 4 (Application developer) at ROCvA Amstelland.
            Developing apps and learning more and more about the technologies
            behind software development gets me excited!
            <br /><br />
            Of course I don't dedicate 100% of my life to coding, I also like to
            create content on YouTube, play video games, build PCs and I love
            live streaming(Podcasts).

          <h3>Application Developer MBO4</h3>
          <h6>Alumnus</h6>
          <p>
            This study has shaped me into a full stack webdeveloper (strong focus on PHP).Besides coding we also learned about other important aspects such as: security,
            documentation, testing and maintenance.
            <br /><br />
            During the 3 years of this study, roughly 60% of the time is spent
            in class. The remaining 40% is spent obtaining job-experience at
            internships.

            As a trainee my tasks vary between documentation, conceptual design
            and developing projects.
            <br /><br />
            I was actively working on a psuedo 3-D game which is being developed
            in Unity using the programming language C#.
